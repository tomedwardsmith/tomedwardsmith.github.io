          <h3 class="text-blue">Driving</h3>
          <p class="text-blue-70 mb-4">The actual location is <a class="text-bluer" href="https://goo.gl/maps/xSHzk5BnboULzEaJ9" target="blank">here</a>. The best bet is to set your sat navs for Cassington in Oxfordshire. As you head north on the A40 (away from Oxford City Centre), there is a left turn into the site, just before the Cassington village turnoff. This will be signposted. If you get to Cassington village then you have gone too far. </p>
          <h3 class="text-blue mt-0">Parking</h3>
          <p class="text-blue-70 mb-4">On entering the site, you will be directed to a parking spot in the parking field by one of our friends wearing a hi-vis. Please follow their instructions; they'll be creating spacing so that people can exit if/when they need to. </p>
          <h3 class="text-blue mt-0">Taxi</h3>
          <p class="text-blue-70">You can get a taxi from Oxford City Rail station to the site in about 25 mins. You can also get a taxi from Oxford Parkway Station, which is closer to Cassington so should work out a little cheaper.</p>
          <p class="text-blue-70 mb-4">Fletch's local pro tip: A cab to Cassington from Oxford City Centre is likely to be much cheaper if pre-booked through Royal Cars. They have a delightfully retro app, which nonetheless works well, or you can call them. They shouldn't charge more than £20.00, as it's only £30.00 to Witney normally.</p> 
          <h3 class="text-blue mt-0">Camper Vans</h3>
          <p class="text-blue-70 mb-4">You are welcome to camp in your own van, however parking for camper vans is separate to both the main parking field, camping field and party field. Someone will show you where to go when you arrive. </p>
          <h3 class="text-blue mt-0">Disabled Access</h3>
          <p class="text-blue-70 mb-4">The main camping and party fields are a 5 minute walk from the parking field. If you require assistance getting to / from the party field then please do <a class="text-bluer" href="mailto:us@dobsonsmith.family">let us know</a>.</p>

          <ul class="text-blue-70" >
            <li>3pm onwards: If you're planning on camping, feel free to arrive from 3pm onwards and get yourself set up and settled in.</li>
            <li>6pm: General arrival, tunes and foods (See <a href="#food-facilities" class="js-scroll-trigger text-bluer">potluck dinner</a> for info)</li>
            <li>8pm: Ceilidh in the large marquee</li>

          <ul class="text-blue-70">
            <li>In the party field all day there'll be music; a ratpack, motown etc playlist AND open decks. <a href="mailto:us@dobsonsmith.family" class="text-bluer">Let us know</a> if you want to do an afternoon set / or plan to bring your guitar / bagpipes etc.</li>

            <li>6:30pm: Dinner (on us).</li>
            <li>9pm: From 9pm the party may become more raucous! Please stay as long as you like. We are assuming some of the older generation will say their farewells at this point and head off for a quieter evening.</li>
            <li>Late late night; can we demolish the trestle table cheeses?</li>

            <li>Campers: Breakfast will be available.</li>
            <li>1pm: The End. We need the site back so the cleanup crew can work their magic.</li>

          <h3 class="text-blue">Kids</h3>
          <p class="text-blue-70">This is a kid friendly event - please bring your spawns. There will be plenty for them to do, and lots of space for them to safely run free.</p>
          <p class="text-blue-70 mb-4">Saturday evening will involve loud music late into the night in a designated rave tent. Kids are welcome to enjoy this at their parents discretion, however it is probably not recommended for younger children, or easily corruptible teens.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-4 text-center">Accomodation</h2>
      <hr class="divider my-4">
      <p>We have hired three fields; a parking field, camping field and a party field. Everyone is warmly welcomed to camp, or glamp or to airbnb/hotel as they wish. We will be camping &#9978;</p>
      <p class="mb-4">We'd really love you to camp with us. In total we've hired 28 acres so there is tonnes of space, and hopefully it will be good weather so it should be thoroughly lovely to wake up in the outdoors! We're also not planning on looking wedding-perfect all the time, so please don't worry about being in airbnb accommodation so you can make your hair nice LOLZ. We certainly won't! This party does not have those vibes.</p>    
      <h3>Getting your stuff from the parking field to the camping field</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">The parking and camping fields are separate. The camping field is a strictly no-vehicle zone, even for loading. It takes about 5 minutes to walk from the parking field to the camping field. Probably a good plan to bring a trolley to help you carry your stuff.</p>
      <h3>Noise</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Please don't worry about getting a good night's sleep in the camping field. Tom is going to clad the party yurt with hay bale walls and that dampens sounds so outside the yurt you should barely hear a thing!</p> 
      <h3>Boats</h3>
      <p class="mb-4"><a href="https://www.anglowelsh.co.uk/Locations/Where-do-we-start-from" target="blank">Anglo Welsh Ltd</a> are based five minutes down the Thames from the bottom of the party field. Be those mad people who hired a canal boat for the weekend! A boat sleeping eight (which has a shower!) costs £1,275 for Friday to Monday (start location Oxford).</p>
      <h3>Camper Vans</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">You are welcome to camp in your own van, however parking for camper vans is separate to both the main parking field and camping field. Someone will show you where to go when you arrive.</p>
      <h3>Pre-erected Bell Tent & Tipi Glamping</h3>
      <p>We've partnered with <a href="https://www.thetipihirecompany.co.uk/" target="blank">The Tipi & Bell Tent Hire Company</a> to give you the option of having someone else put up a rather nice tent for you in advance!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Their 4m luxury, quality cotton canvas bell tents cost £180, sleeps 2-4 people and is furnished with memory foam mattresses (double or single mattress configurations are available), colourful rugs, throws, cushions, fairy lights, a low table and lamp.</li>
        <li>Their 5m bell tent sleeps up to 6 people, costs £220 and is decorated as above.</li>
        <li>Their 6m party bell tent sleeps 8 people and costs £300. These beautiful tents are decorated with comfy memory foam mattresses covered in throws that double up as seating, cushions, rugs, low tables, lamps and fairy lights.</li>
        <li>Bedding packages cost £25 for a single quilt, sheet and pillow set, £30 for a double set or £20 for a sleeping bag and pillow set.</li>
        <li>Your tent will be ready on the day with a name tag attached.</li>
        <li>They also do massive tipis if you want to go all out!</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-5">If you're interested in glamping please let us know via the RSVP form. We will then send instructions on how to book to the interested parties. (Note: we do need to hit a minimum order of 8 tents for it to be possible, which is why we need to gauge interest first).</p>

          <p class="text-blue"><strong>Friday evening</strong></p>
          <p class="text-blue-70">We are planning a potluck supper, as that's what we had the night we got together! This will be in the big marquee (tables and chairs provided - someone did ask!).</p>
          <p class="text-blue-70">We will provide a few big dishes of food and salads, but, if you wish, please bring one of the following to go on the long trestle tables:</p>
          <ul class="text-blue-70">
            <li>Something where you're from is known for; e.g. a Melton Mowbray pork pie, Cornwall cider, Lake District gingerbread, your local cheese.</li>
            <li>something you're known for; e.g. Tim Lee's waffles, Harriet Castle's oatcakes.</li>
            <li>Something else, surprise us!</li>
            <li>There'll be paper available so you can label up what you've brought with your name and your/its story :)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-blue-70">Please bring your own crockery, cutlery and cups / beakers. Please don't bring actual glassware as we have a no glass rule, but melamine mugs / plastic camping cups are totally fine. Please don't bring single use plastic cups!</p>
          <p class="text-blue"><strong>Saturday</strong></p>
          <ul class="text-blue-70">
            <li>A van serving breakfasts will be around for campers. (You'll need some cash.) </li>
            <li>Lunch will also be available from streetfood vans with options from around a fiver. Again, please make sure you have cash &#129297;</li>
            <li>Dinner will be from 6:30pm (on us)!</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-blue"><strong>Sunday - the morning after the night before</strong></p>
          <p class="text-blue-70 mb-4">Breakfast will be available again for the campers. Look: unwashed.</p>
          <h3 class="text-blue">Dress Code</h3>
          <p class="text-blue"><strong>Friday</strong></p>
          <p class="text-blue-70">Something you can ceilidh in :) Highland dress with festival accessories strongly encouraged.</p>
          <p class="text-blue-70">There will be a wooden dance floor in the big marquee but heels are still a silly idea as you'll get stuck in the ground as soon as you step off it.</p>
          <p class="text-blue"><strong>Saturday daytime</strong></p>
          <p class="text-blue-70">Either garden party vibes (gents this means shirt and trousers) or ridiculous festival outfit (shorts and t-shirt does not count!)</p>
          <p class="text-blue"><strong>Saturday evening</strong></p>
          <p class="text-blue-70">Disco / Festi / Glitter vibes</p>
          <p class="text-blue"><strong>Sunday</strong></p>
          <p class="text-blue-70 mb-4">Whatever you've got left that's clean(ish)</p>
          <h3 class="text-blue">Drinking Water</h3>
          <p class="text-blue-70">Drinking water will be provided via taps in the party and camping fields. Please bring a reusable water bottle.</p>
          <h3 class="text-blue">Alcoholic / Soft Drinks</h3>
          <p class="text-blue-70">Some booze will be provided (prosecco, pimms, wine, beer, cider, whisky), however we are not billionaires so it may run out (although Dobs has done her best drink planning to ensure it doesn't). Feel free to bring your own if you're worried or have a drink problem.</p>
          <p class="text-blue-70 mb-4">There won't be anywhere to buy drinks on site or nearby so plan accordingly.</p>
          <h3 class="text-blue">Odd Drinks Amnesty</h3>
          <p class="text-blue-70 mb-4">Please do bring that odd bottle of your favourite thing which is never available / which you were given by an aunt / got in the airport / which is no longer identifiable and add it to the Adventurous Abandoned Drinks Table. Minesweepers delight.</p>
          <h3 class="text-blue">No glass rule</h3>
          <p class="text-blue-70 mb-4">Please do not bring glass onto the site. If you are bringing your own beverages then please decant them into something plastic, or preferably something reusable. The fields are used for grazing animals throughout the year and broken glass is bad for them.</p>
          <h3 class="text-blue">Toilets</h3>
          <p class="text-blue-70">Toilets come in the form of either composting toilets or portaloos. We have no access to indoor plumbing so these are the only facilities available.</p>
          <p class="text-blue-70 mb-4">Please treat the toilets with respect - there are no cleaners bar us! So leave them as you want to find them.</p>

            <li>Own bunting? Bring it and put it up!</li>
            <li>Ridiculous outdoor decorations/furniture? Bring them, put them out</li>
            <li>Outdoor games. Croquet, cricket, quoits, weird regional variations? Bring them</li>
            <li>Boats! The Thames is at the bottom of the party field. Own an inflatable boat or a kayak? Bring it.</li>
            <li>Something for the potluck supper. More in the <a href="#food-facilities" class="js-scroll-trigger text-bluer">food & facilities</a> section.</li>
            <li>Cash! You'll need some for the streetfood vans.</li>
            <li>Some sturdy shoes. There are no hard paths, and the ground can be uneven. If it is wet, then wellies will probably be a good idea. </li>
            <li>A torch. There is very little light pollution at night, so the camping field gets very dark. Bring a torch so you can see where you are going. </li>
            <li>A reusable water bottle. Drinking water will be available from taps situated in the camping and party fields. Bottled water will not be available.</li>
            <li>Bring your own Booooze! See the <a href="#food-facilities" class="js-scroll-trigger text-bluer">food, facilities and dress code</a> section for more info.</li>
            <li>A phone battery brick or solar charger. We are running off generator power so cannot provide power sockets for phone charging. Please make your own arrangements to keep your phone charged. </li>
            <li>Toothbrush. Don't forget it.</li>

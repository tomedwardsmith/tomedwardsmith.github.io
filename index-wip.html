The best bet is to set your sat navs for Cassington in Oxfordshire. As you head north on the A40 (away from Oxford City Centre), there is a left turn into the site, just before the Cassington village turnoff. This will be signposted. If you get to Cassington village then you have gone too far. </p>
          <h3 class="text-white mt-0">Parking</h3>
          <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">On entering the site, you will be directed to a parking spot in the parking field by one of our friends wearing a hi-vis. Please follow their instructions; they’ll be creating spacing so that people can exit if/when they need to. </p>
          <h3 class="text-white mt-0">Taxi</h3>
          <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">You can get a taxi from Oxford City Rail station to the site in about 25 mins. It should cost around £35. </p>
          <h3 class="text-white mt-0">Camper Vans</h3>
          <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">You are welcome to camp in your own van, however parking for camper vans is separate to both the main parking field, camping field and party field. Someone will show you where to go when you arrive. </p>
          <h3 class="text-white mt-0">Disabled Access</h3>
          <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">The main camping and party fields are a 5 minute walk from the parking field. If you require assistance getting to / from the party field then please do let us know.</p>

          <h3>Do I have to come for the whole thing?</h3>
          <p class="text-muted mb-4">No - come for as much or as little as you like. The itinerary below should help you to work out which bits you would like to attend.</p>
          <h3>Friday 14th August</h3>
          <ul class="text-muted" >
            <li>3pm onwards: If you’re planning on camping, feel free to arrive from 3pm onwards and get yourself set up and settled in.</li>
            <li>6pm: General arrival, tunes and foods (See <a href="#food-facilities" class="js-scroll-trigger">potluck dinner</a> for info)</li>
            <li>8pm: Ceilidh in the large marquee</li>
            <li>10pm: Disco tunes, but not too late!</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Saturday 15th August</h3>
          <ul class="text-muted">
            <li>12pm onwards: From midday there will be streetfood vans in the party field ready to sate your hunger.</li>
            <li>In the party field all afternoon there’ll be music; a ratpack, motown etc paylist AND open decks. <a href="mailto:us@dobsonsmith.family">Let us know</a> if you want to do an afternoon set / or plan to bring your guitar / bagpipes etc.</li> 
            <li>There will be pimms, bouncy castles and outdoor games (rounders, badminton, croquet etc) all afternoon</li>
            <li>5pm: Hog roast time!</li>
            <li>9pm: From 9pm the party may become more raucous! Please stay as long as you like. We are assuming some of the older generation will say their farewells at this point and head off for a quieter evening.</li>
            <li>Late late night; can we demolish the trestle table cheeses?</li>
            <li>End: Rave tent survivors photo</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Sunday 16th August</h3> 
          <ul class="text-muted">
            <li>Breakfast? Get a big communal BBQ going with eggs bacon etc?</li>
            <li>Please pack up and be gone by 1pm ????</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Kids</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">This is a kid friendly event - please bring your spawns. There will be plenty for them to do, and lots of space for them to safely run free.</p>
          <p class="text-muted mb-4">Saturday evening will involve loud music late into the night in a designated rave tent. Kids are welcome to enjoy this at their parents discretion, however it is probably not recommended for younger children, or easily corruptible teens.</p>
          <h3>What happens if it rains?</h3>
          <p class="text-muted mb-5">We all go in the big marquee - simple.</p>

  <section class="page-section bg-dark text-white" id="accomodation">
    <div class="container text-left">
      <h2 class="mb-4 text-center">Accomodation</h2>
      <hr class="divider my-4">
      <p>We have hired three fields; a parking field, camping field and a party field. Everyone is warmly welcomed to camp, or glamp or to airbnb/hotel as they wish. We will be camping &#9978;</p>
      <p class="mb-4">We’d really love you to camp with us. In total we’ve hired 28 acres so there is tonnes of space, and hopefully it will be good weather so it should be thoroughly lovely to wake up in the outdoors! We’re also not planning on looking wedding-perfect all the time, so please don’t worry about being in airbnb accommodation so you can make your hair nice LOLZ. We certainly won’t! This party does not have those vibes.</p>    
      <h3>Getting your stuff from the parking field to the camping field</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">The parking and camping fields are separate. The camping field is a strictly no-vehicle zone, even for loading. It takes about 5 minutes to walk from the parking field to the camping field. Probably a good plan to bring a trolley to help you carry your stuff.</p>
      <h3>Noise</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Please don’t worry about getting a good night’s sleep in the camping field. Tom is planning on cladding the party yurt with hay bales and that dampens sounds so outside the yurt you should barely hear anything.</p>
      <h3>Pre-erected Yurt & Bell Tent Glamping</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">We’ve found a lovely provider who will put up a rather nice tent for you, with the simplest starting at £XX amount. Do we need people to say what they want to do or if we pick a nice provider can we just direct people to there if they want to book?</p>
      <h3>Boats</h3>
      <p class="mb-4"><a href="https://www.anglowelsh.co.uk/Locations/Where-do-we-start-from" target="blank">Anglo Welsh Ltd</a> are based five minutes down the Thames from the bottom of the party field. Be those mad people who hired a canal boat for the weekend! A boat sleeping eight (which has a shower!) costs £1,275 for Friday to Monday (start location Oxford).</p>
      <h3>Camper Vans</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">You are welcome to camp in your own van, however parking for camper vans is separate to both the main parking field and camping field. Someone will show you where to go when you arrive.</p>

          <hr class="divider my-4">
            <h3>Food</h3>
            <p class="text-muted">Please bring your own cutlery and cups / beakers. Please don’t bring actual glassware as we have a no glass rule, but melamine mugs / plastic camping cups are totally fine. Please don’t bring single use plastic cups!</p>
            <p><strong>Friday evening</strong></p>
            <p class="text-muted">We are planning a potluck supper, as that’s what we had the night we got together! This will be in the big marquee (tables and chairs provided - someone did ask!).</p>
          <p class="text-muted">We will provide a few big dishes of food and salads, but, if you wish, please bring one of the following to go on the long trestle tables:</p>
          <ul class="text-muted">
            <li>Something where you’re from is known for; e.g. a Melton Mowbray pork pie, Cornwall cider, Lake District gingerbread, your local cheese.</li>
            <li>something you’re known for; e.g. Tim Lee’s waffles, Harriet Castle’s oatcakes.</li>
            <li>Something else, surprise us!</li>
            <li>There’ll be paper available so you can label up what you’ve brought with your name and your/its story :)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>
          <ul class="text-muted">
            <li>Sort yourselves out with breakfast</li>
            <li>Lunch will be available from vans with options for around a fiver.</li>
            <li>Dinner will be a Hog Roast from 5pm with trimmings!</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Sunday - the morning after the night before</strong></p>
          <p class="text-muted mb-4">We’ll organise a big breakfast of all the usual things for the camping field. Look: unwashed.</p>
          <h3>Dress Code</h3>
          <p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
          <p class="text-muted">Something you can ceilidh in :) Highland dress with festival accessories strongly encouraged.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">There will be a wooden dance floor in the big marquee but heels are still a silly idea as you’ll get stuck in the ground as soon as you step off it.</p>
          <p><strong>Saturday daytime</strong></p>
          <p class="text-muted">Either garden party vibes (gents this means shirt and trousers) or ridiculous festival outfit (shorts and t-shirt does not count!)</p>
          <p><strong>Saturday evening</strong></p>
          <p class="text-muted">Disco / Festi / Glitter vibes</p>
          <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>
          <p class="text-muted mb-4">Whatever you’ve got left that’s clean(ish)</p>
          <h3>Drinking Water</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">Drinking water will be provided via taps in the party and camping fields. Please bring a reusable water bottle.</p>
          <h3>Alcoholic / Soft Drinks</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">Some booze will be provided (prosecco, pimms, wine, beer, cider, whisky), however we are not billionaires so it may run out (although Dobs has done her best drink planning to ensure it doesn’t). Feel free to bring your own if you’re worried or have a drink problem.</p>
          <p class="text-muted mb-4">There won’t be anywhere to buy drinks on site or nearby so plan accordingly.</p>
          <h3>Odd Drinks Amnesty</h3>
          <p class="text-muted mb-4">Please do bring that odd bottle of your favourite thing which is never available / which you were given by an aunt / got in the airport / which is no longer identifiable and add it to the adventurous abandoned drinks table. Minesweepers delight.</p>
          <h3>No glass rule</h3>
          <p class="text-muted mb-4">Please do not bring glass onto the site. If you are bringing your own beverages then please decant them into either something plastic, or preferably something re-usable. The fields are used for grazing animals throughout the year and broken glass is bad for them.</p>
          <h3>Toilets</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">Toilets come in the form of either portaloos or composting toilets. We have no access to indoor plumbing so these are the only facilities available.</p>
          <p class="text-muted mb-4">Please treat the toilets with respect - there are no cleaners bar us! So leave them as you want to find them.</p>

          <ul class="text-white-50 mt-0">
            <li>Something for the potluck supper. More in the <a href="#food-facilities" class="js-scroll-trigger text-white">food & facilities</a> section.</li>
            <li>Some sturdy shoes. There are no hard paths, and the ground is uneven. If it is wet, then wellies will probably be a good idea. </li>
            <li>A torch. There is very little light pollution at night, so the camping field gets very dark. Bring a torch so you can see where you are going. </li>
            <li>A reusable water bottle. Drinking water will be available from taps situated in the camping and party fields. Bottled water will not be available.</li>
            <li>Bring your own Booooze! See the <a href="#food-facilities" class="js-scroll-trigger text-white">food, facilities and dress code</a> section for more info.</li>
            <li>A phone battery brick or solar charger. We are running off generator power so cannot provide power sockets for phone charging. Please make your own arrangements to keep your phone charged. </li>
            <li>Own bunting? Bring it and put it up!</li>
            <li>Ridiculous outdoor decorations/furniture? Bring them, put them out</li>
            <li>Outdoor games. Croquet, cricket, quoits, weird regional variations? Bring them</li>
            <li>Boats! The Thames is at the bottom of the party field. Own an inflatable boat or a kayak? Bring it.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush. Don’t forget it.</li>

      <p>For some of you it’s a really long way to come, and you will go to some expense over accommodation and travel etc. We have no huge wedding list of items which we are hoping you will get for us; we’re just hoping to see you and to have lovely times with you.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">However, if you're someone who just really likes getting people nice gifts/experiences, and would feel awful if you weren't able to give us something, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KtvbzH9xC0IDXENPSpu5bphN4yBxAzn3oknyfJDCzJY/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">here's</a> a short list here of random things that we like!</p>
